# Overview

Project to casually explore creating a blog using the bookdown software. See below link for a sampler of what it could look like. I decided to switch to substack, so this project is mostly dead for now.
I may re-open it again at some distant future date if I accrued a collection of insightful notebooks that I can compile into a textbook.
